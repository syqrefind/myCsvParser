# myCsvParser


Requirements:

* It only needs to parse single lines at a time, and each line is independent of the others. i.e. There is no need to ensure lines have the same number of arguments.
* It must support comma as the field separator.
* It must support quotes strings with embedded commas.

## Part 1: Build a Basic CSV File Processor Using an Available Library

#### Step 1.1 Basic Code Structure

##### Requirements:

* Process a line at a time. Isolate the parser into a function.
* Demonstrate TDD.
* Write a test mode to feed a series of tests into the parser function and validate the output.
  Testing:
* Write a number of test inputs and outputs. Use colon as the separator on the outputs to avoid any confusion. (Do not use colon in any test data.)

##### Evaluation:

* Is the test data sufficient? Did you check for quoted strings? Multiple quoted strings on the same line?

* Does the parser pass all tests?

* Write a number of test inputs and outputs. Use colon as the separator on the outputs to avoid any confusion. (Do not use colon in any test data.)
  e.g.

  Input A,B,"C",D --> Output: A:B:C:Dâ€¨

  Input A, "B,C", D --> Output A:B,C:D

#### Step 1.2 Performance Baseline (Control Loop)

Add timing checks to establish a performance benchmark for the processor when run across various sample sizes.

##### Requirements:

* Establish code that measures the execution time (microseconds) for X iterations over the parsing function.
* Separate the parsing function from the control code.
* Establish a mechanism to support alternate parsing functions.

##### Evaluation:

* All tests pass. A performance baseline is established for 1000 iterations.
* The code is reviewed for correctness and simplicity.


#### Step 1.3 Result

###### Test sample data

Input csv = 4 rows

```
Name,Store Number,Features,Phone Number,Insert Date,Owner
,11854,"Lunch, Oven-warmed Food, Reserve Amenity",6036798789,6/22/12
Stop & Shop-Exeter #204,79420,,603-772-1783,6/22/12,"Geoff"
"Seabrook, Lafayette Rd", 13448,"Lunch",603-474-3674,6/22/12
```

Output

###### Test data using different code strategies

Added more records to compare the performance. 

Now input csv = 1400+ records

Parser.class include two methods, same input and output, different logic:

1. Method1  using regex

   Slow.

   Need about 112 milliseconds to parse 1400 records. 

   ![image-20210117230219018](src/main/resources/images/image-20210117230219018.png)

2. Method2 using the code, logic, for loop, if else

   Fast.

   Need about 24 milliseconds to parse 1400 records.
